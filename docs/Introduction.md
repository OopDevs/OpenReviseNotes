# Development

----

Open Revise is developed by two high school students in Malaysia, with simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript codding and  webpage designing. We do know that it is far away from perfect and to be honest we do not ever expect it to be perfect!

> Nowadays, most of the revision websites on the Internet require subscription and have a ton of ads, which we believe are not good enough for students to concentrate on their studies. Thus, the idea of making a free open source website popped up. In this website, you can find whatever you need and whatever you want without searching all over the world wide web and it is even possible for you to use it offline!
>
> The concept of this website is really simple: 
>
> **"We want a student-friendly place for sharing and gaining knowledge with less distraction and relaxing atmosphere."**
>
> As a student, I do understand the importance of class notes and thus, the major feature of Open Revise is the **Notes Viewer**. We have tried several ways of presenting the notes and finally, we decided to have a built in iframe viewer which can present the notes in HTML format with best quality and clarity. The most amazing part of iframe is that everything in under **ONE WEBPAGE**. This makes our **Concentration Mood** possible with built-in Music Player and Timer which will significantly improve your learning efficiency.
>
> So, here is what we have done so far and hope you enjoy it. If you have any problem/issue while using the website, do not hesitate to contact us. We will be keep updating and improving the website and your support will mean a lot to us.

> **Best regards,**
