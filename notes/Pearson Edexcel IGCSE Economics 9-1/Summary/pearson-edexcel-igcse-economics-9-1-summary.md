>Labour Intensive - Countries with high population will use labour as the workforce because it is Cheaper and Easy to Get. (China)
But it has Low Productivity compare with machinery and it is Difficult to Manage/Control.

>Capita Intensive - Countries with less population may use Machinery (capital) to produce goods because the cost for labour is too high. (Western Countries)
>Machines normally have High Productivity but they need High Technology to support them in order to work properly.

-  Productivity is the amount of Output that can be produced with a given quantity of resources; the output per unit of input.

-  How to increase Productivity
^ Retrain the workers becime more skilled
^ Use machinery / Improve technology
^ Motivate the workers (increase wage)
^ Introduce new working practices
^ Division of labours (Production Chain)
^ Use existing factors more efficiently.
