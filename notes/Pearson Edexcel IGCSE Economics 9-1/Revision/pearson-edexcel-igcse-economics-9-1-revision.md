### Unit 1 - The Economic Problem

> Key Points:
>
> - Problem of Scarcity
> - Opportunity Cost
> - Production Possibility Curves
> - Economic Growth

\> Resources: water, minerals, soil, plants, animals and people (labour)

\> Factors of Production: Land, Labour, Capital & Enterprise

\> Scarce Resources: resources with limited supply

\> Needs: basic requirements for human survival, e.g Water, Food, Shelter & Clothing

\> Wants: people's desires for goods and services.

\> **Infinite Wants > Scarce Resources**

\> Basic Economic Problems:

| What to Produce:           | How to Produce:     | For Whom to Produce:   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| - Satisfy people's desires | - Labour Intensive  | - For poor people      |
| - Making a profit          | - Capital Intensive | - For rich people      |
| - For welfares             |                     | - For particular group |

\> Resource Distribution: sharing resources among a large group of parties in a planned way

\> Opportunity Cost: the value of next best alternative given up when making a choice.

**Economic Is The Study of Making Choice**

\> PPC (Production Possibility Curve): The combination of two goods that can be produced by using all the resources and current technologies.

| PPC shifts Inwards:       | PPC shifts Outwards:             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| - Resources decline       | - Development of Technology      |
| - Pollution decreases     | - New resources discovered       |
| - Unstable Politics       | - Economics Growth               |
| - War / Natural disaster. | - More Population (more labours) |

### Unit 2 - Economic Assumption

> Key Points:
>
> - The underlying assumption in economics
> - Why consumers might not maximize their benefit
> - Why producers may not maximize their profit
>

> **Reasons why consumers may not always maximize their benefits:**
>
> - It is difficult to calculate the benefits from consuming a product.
> - Buying Habits - Brand
> - Influenced by the behavior of others

> **Reasons why producers may not always maximize their profit:**
>
> - Complex management of businesses - decision making
> - Alternative businesses objectives - costumer care & service
> - Non-profit organization (charities)
> - Marketing strategies (Better quality with same price)

| Private Sector: (business in the market)                     | Public Sector: (government)                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Provides private goods                                     | Provides public goods                                     |
| - Aims: Survival, Profit Maximization, Growth (E.O.S), Social Responsibility | Aims: Improving quality of services, Minimizing Cost.     |
| - They produce what consumers may willing to buy             | It has non-excludability                                  |
|                                                              | It has non-rivalry, e.g: National defense, Education etc. |

------

### Unit 3 - The Economic Systems

> **Types of Goods:**
>
> - Consumer Goods: for households, e.g Food, cars, furnitures
> - Capital Goods: produce other goods, e.g Machinery, tools, equipment
> - Public Goods: non-profit-aimed good, e.g Street Lighting, education
> - Inferior Goods: cheap, low quality, e.g Tesco, Mr.DIY
> - Luxury Goods: expensive, high quality, e.g sport cars, apartment
> - Normal Goods: has positive YED (*price elasticity of demand)

> **Three types of Economies:**
>
> - Planned Economy/Command Economy: resources allocation are decided by the government.
> - Free Economy/Market Economy: resources allocation are decided by the market
> - Mixed Economy: both market and government can decide the allocation of resources.

> **Market Failure:**
>
> - Externalities: Pollution
>
> - Lack of competition:
>
>   1. Price increases
>
>   2. Limited choice
>
> - Missing Market: merit goods
>
> - Lack of information
>
> - Factor immobility

### Unit 4 - Privatization

\> Privatization is the transfer of resources/ firms from Public Sector to Private Sector by sale/lease/contract.

| Advantages                                                  | 'Disadvantages                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Better services and quality due to competition (consumer)   | High price and low quality goods due to **Monopoly** (consumer) |
| Lower prices and more choices due to competition (consumer) | Private sector may charge more in order to achieve **profit maximization** (consumer) |
| Reduce burden and get revenues from taxes (government)      | Less social welfare (government)                             |
| Higher wage rates and more perks (labors)                   | Unemployment (labors)                                        |
| Better working environment and infrastructures (labors)     | Over-worked (labors)                                         |
| Higher productivity (labors)                                | Hostile takeover (business)                                  |
| More profit can be made and more investment (business)      |                                                              |
| Brand name and E.O.S (business)                             |                                                              |

------

### Unit 5 - Externalities

\> Externalities are the spill-over effects of production and consumption.

\> The production or consumption of a good will have costs that can be divided into * **private costs** and external costs. 

(* costs of an economic activity to individuals and firms)

| **External Costs of Production**                             | **External Benefits of Consumption**                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Incurred by Third Parties                                    | E.g: Education (highly skilled), Health Care (work effectively), Vaccinations |
| E.g: Noise Pollution, Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Resource Wastes, Traffic |                                                              |

Social Cost = Private Costs + External Costs

Social Benefit = Private Benefit + External Benefit

### Unit 6 - The Factors of Production and Sectors of The Economy

\> **Production:** converting raw materials into goods or services.

> **Factors of Production:**
>
> - Land
> - Labour
> - Capital
> - Enterprise

\> **Two Types of Production:**

| **Labour Intensive**                                         | **Capital Intensive**                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Countries with **high population** will use labour as the workforce because it is Cheaper and Easy to Get. (China, India) | Countries with less population may use **Machinery** (capital) to produce goods because the cost for labour is too high. (Western Countries) |
| It has Low Productivity compare with machinery and it is **Difficult to Manage.** | Machines normally have High Productivity but they need High Technology to support them in order to work properly. |

\> **Sectors of The Economy:** 

| **Primary Sector**                                           | **Secondary Sector**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Production involving the extraction of raw materials from the earth. | Production involving the processing of raw materials into finished and semi-finished goods. |
| **Less developed countries** concentrate on primary industry. | **Developing countries** (China, India) concentrate on seconday industry. |
| E.g: Agriculture, Fishing, Forestry, Mining                  | E.g: Car Production, Manufacturing, Construction, Food Processing |

------

### Unit 7 - Productivity and Division of Labour

\> Productivity: the amount of Output that can be produced with a given quantity of resources. (output / input)

\> Division of Labour: breaking down of the production process into tasks with each workers are allocated to a specific task.

> **How to increase Productivity:**
>
> - Retrain the workers become more skilled
> - Use machinery / Improve technology
> - Motivate the workers (increase wage)
> - Introduce new working practices
> - Division of labours (Production Chain)
> - Use existing factors more efficiently.

| **Benefits of Division of Labour:**   | **Disadvantages:**       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| - Faster                              | - Lack of other skills   |
| - Productivity increases              | - Boring                 |
| - Output increases                    | - Less motivation        |
| - Employment increases (more skilled) | - High cost for training |
| - Less mistakes                       |                          |

------

### Unit 8 - Business Costs, Revenues and Profits

| **Fixed Cost**                 | **Variable Cost**                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Does not change in short run.  | Varies over time.                          |
| Equipment, rent, wages etc.    | Raw materials, electronic/water bills etc. |
| Does not depend on production. | Changes with production.                   |

> **Equations:**
>
> - Total Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost
> - Average Cost = Total Cost / Quantity
> - Revenue = Total Output x Price
> - Profit = Revenue - Total Cost

------

### Unit 9 - Economics of Scale

**>** Economies of Scale (E.O.S) - falling average costs due to Expansion (for large firms).

> **Internal E.O.S** - benefits that an individual firms can benefit from when it expands.
>
> - Purchasing E.O.S / Bulk-Buying: cheaper raw materials.
> - Marketing E.O.S : advertisement, brand name etc. 
> - Technical E.O.S (more capital)
> - Financial E.O.S (low interest rate)
> - Risk-bearing E.O.S (wide product range.
>

> **External E.O.S** - benefits all firms in the industry.
>
> - Skilled Labour
> - Infrastructure
> - Commercial Services
> - Co-operation

------

>   2. Better quality
>
>   3. More choice
>
> - **Disadvantage:**
>
>   1. Market uncertainty

>   2. Lack of innovation due to the firms have less profit to spend.
>

> **Competition and Economy:**
>
> - **Advantage:**
>
>   1. Resources can be allocated more efficiently.
>
>   2. More employment (due to more businesses in the market)
>
>   3. Better standard of living,

>   4. Economic growth
>
> - **Disadvantage:**
>
>   1. Resources might be wasted.
>
>   2. Lack of regulations and control of the market.

------

### Unit 1 - Economic Growth

\> An increase in GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

\> Increase in real GDP (GDP adjusted for inflation) means there is an increase in the value of national expenditure (output)

\> Economic Growth enables increased living standards and helps create new jobs

> #### Causes of Economic Growth:
>
> - Increase in **Aggregate Demand** *(or GDP)*
>
> - Increase in **Aggregate Supply** *(more capital, investment,production etc.)*
>
> - Expansionary Policy *(fiscal, monetary & supply side)*
>
> - **Supply side policies**
>
> - **Discovery of more natural resources:** 
>   - more resources mean more the production capacity.
>
> - **Investment in new capital and infrastructure:**
>
>   - Investment on new machinery, buildings, technology has enabled firms and economies to expand their production capacities. Investments in modern infrastructure such as airports, roads and labours have improved access and communication in an economy, helping in quicker and efficient production.
>
> - **Technical progress:** 
>
>   - New inventions and production processes can increase the productivity of existing resources in industries and help boost economic growth.
>
> - **Reallocating resources:** 
>
>   - Moving resources from less-productive uses to more-productive uses will improve economic growth.
>
> - **Increasing the amount and quality of human resources:**
>
>   - A larger and more productive workforce will increase GDP. More skilled, knowledgeable and productive human resources thus help increase economic growth

**Aggregate Demand (GDP) = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + (Exports - Imports)**

(Aggregate demand is the total demand in the economy. It is equals to GDP)

> #### Measuring Economics Growth:
>
> GDP is the most common measure of Economics Growth. This measures a country's total output for the year.

> #### Limitations of Using GDP:
>
> - **Inflation:** 
>   - Price increases can destroy growth rate. (if inflation rate = growth rate, there is no economics growth)
>   - Solution: real GDP
> - **Population changes:**
>
>   - If population increase rate = growth rate, there is no economics growth.
>   - Solution: GDP per capita
> - **Statistical error:**
>   - Errors can be made in collection and entering data.
>   - The true value of GDP is never really known.
> - **Value of home produced goods:**
>   - Some goods and services are not traded.
> - **The hidden economy:**
>   - Sometimes paid work goes unrecorded.
> - **GDP & Living Standards:**
>   - GDP rises does not aromatically improve the living standards.
> - **External Cost:**
>   - Environmental costs

> #### The Economics Cycle:
>
> - **Boom:**
>
>   - Peak of the economic cycle where GDP is growing at its fastest rate.
>   - This can be caused by a good performance of the country's economy.
>
>   - Effects:
>
>     - Existing firms will be expanding.
>     - New firms will be entering the market.
>     - Demand will be rising.
>     - Jobs will be created.
>     - Wages will be rising.
>     - Profit will be rising.
>
> - **Downturn:**
>
>   - A boom will be followed by a downturn (always).
>   - Slower rate.
>
>   - Effects:
>
>     - Demand for goods and services will stop increasing or begin to fall.
>     - Unemployment will start to rise.
>     - Wage will not be increasing.
>     - Many firms will stop expanding.
>     - Some firms may leave the market.
>     - Prices will rise more slowly.
>
> - **Rescission or Depression:**
>
>   - The bottom of the economic cycle.
>   - Associated with widespread poverty.
>
>   - Effects:
>
>     - Demand will start to fall for many goods and services, particularly non-essentials.
>     - Unemployment rises sharply.
>     - Business confidence is very low.
>     - Bankruptcies rise.
>     - Prices become flat.
>     - A less severe version of depression is a recession.
>
> - **Recovery:**
>
>   - GDP starts to rise again.
>   - Effects:
>
>     - Business regain their confidence.
>     - Demand starts to rise.
>     - Unemployment begins to fall.
>     - Prices start to rise again.
>
> 

> #### The Impact of Economics Growth:
>
> - Generally economics growth is beneficial, but not always.
>
> - **Employment:**
>
>   - Economics Growth == Business generating more output
>   - More production == More workers are needed
>   - Governments tend to spend more for education, health care and infrastructure.
>   - Thus, more **jobs are created and raises employment levels**.
>
> - **Standard of Living:**
>
>   - Increases in GDP == More income (in average)
>   - More disposable income == More goods and services can be purchased
>   - **Thus, people can buy better quality food, improved shelter and more leisure goods**.
>   - Due to the improvements in efficiency (technology for example), it is possible for workers to **spend less time working**.
>   - **People are living longer with affordable medical services and healthier diets**.
>
> - **Poverty:**
>
>   - Economic Growth reduce poverty.
>   - More jobs are created due to the expansion of existing businesses and the development of new businesses.
>   - A growing economy means the government can **collect more taxes revenues**.
>   - The extra government spending is often targeted at the poor, which help reduce poverty.
>
> - **Production Potential:**
>   - A country can produce more goods and services.
>   - **The PPC curve will shift outward**.
>
> - **Inflation:**
>
>   - If economic growth is too fast, the economy may overheat.
>   - **Overheat:**
>
>     - Demand rises too fast, causing prices and imports to rise.
>     - **Solution: contraction monetary & fiscal policies**.
>
>   - This can cause inflation which is bad for an economy.
>
>   - **Inflation will lower down the living standard**.
>
> - **The Environment:**
>
>   - Externalities (social cost)
>   - High levels of pollution have accompanied high levels of economic growth.
>   - Non-renewable resources are being used.
>   - This is referred to as **unsustainable growth**.

| **Benefits of Economics Growth**                             | **Potential Costs of Economics Growth**                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Higher Income                                                | Inflation: the economy may overheat (demand raised too fast, price and imports will increase) |
| Increased tax revenue for government which can be spent on public services. | Current account deficit (demand raised, need more supply, import > export) |
| Employment: more demand == more supply == more labors needed | Environmental cost due to high consumption and production (pollution) |
| More leisure time and greater life expectancy (standard of living will be improved) | Inequality: the benefits of economics growth may not be distribute equally. |
| Better public services                                       | Unsustainable growth: use up non-renewable resources.        |
| Productive potential will increase (PPC shifts out)          |                                                              |
| Reduced poverty                                              |                                                              |
| More goods and services available                            |                                                              |

### Unit 2 - Inflation

\> Def: a general and continuing rise in prices over a period of time.

\> It's often caused by economic growth.

\> Sometimes prices fall over time which is referred to as **Deflation**.

\> Deflation may also be used to describe a slowdown in the economy where aggregate demand is falling.

> #### Measure Inflation: 
>
> - **Consumer Price Index (CPI):**
>
>   - measure of general price level (excluding housing costs)
>
> - **Retail Price Index (RPI):**
>   - measure of the general price level, which includes house prices and council tax.
>

> #### Types of Inflation:
>
> - Inflation may be caused by different factors.
>
> - **Demand-Pull Inflation:**
>
>   - Caused by too much demand in the economy.
>   - If the aggregate demand increase, there will be an increase in the general price level.
>
>   - **It can be caused by:**
>     - rising consumer spending encouraged by expansionary policies (tax cuts & low interest rates).
>     - sharp increase in government spending.
>     - rising demand for resources by firms (for certain goods).
>     - booming demand for exports.
>
>   - Demand-pull inflation is most likely to occur if the economy is close to full employment because the it's difficult for businesses to increase the output if they are close to full capacity. 
>
> - **Cost-Push Inflation:**
>
>   - Caused by rising costs.
>   - Businesses put up their prices to **protect their profit margins**.
>
>   - **Costs might rise for a number of reasons:**
>
>     - rising costs of imported goods (materials), such as oil.
>     - wage increases (caused by the trade unions).
>     - increases in taxation.

> #### The relationship between Inflation & Interest Rate:
>
> - Inflation is held by a group of economists called **monetarists**.
> - Monetarists believe there is a strong link between inflation and growth in the money supply.
> - When the interest rate is low, households. firms and the government borrow money from banks to fund extra spending.
> - This increases the money supply.
> - The money lend by the banks creates more demand and thus prices are driven up.
> - This is also referred to as an effect of expansionary monetary policy.

> #### Impact of Inflation:
>
> - **Purchasing power of money will be reduced:**
>
>   - People cannot buy as much as before with their income. 
>   - Therefore the **living standard will be lower**.
>   - A solution for this can be an increase in income.
>
> - As the prices are increasing, **labors need more income to improve the living standard**.
>
>   - Higher wages will be asked by the labors and thus, the production costs of the firms will increase. 
>   - As a result, the prices will keep increasing and this can cause a conflict. 
>   - Such conflict could result in a strike and both labors and firms will lose out. 
>
> - If inflation is higher at home than in other countries, **it will be difficult to sell goods overseas.** 
>

>
> - **The firms will employ more labors.**
>
>   - High levels of inflation usually mean that aggregate demand is rising. Supply will also increase due to the high demand.
>   - As a result, **more people will get jobs and unemployment rate will decrease**.
>

### Unit 3 - Unemployment

\> Unemployed people are defined as those **who want a job but cannot find work**. 

\> Their living standards will be very low compare to those employed people because **they do not have stable income**.

\> **Unemployment is defined as those without a job but who are actively seeking work at current wage rates.**

\> Unemployment is a waste of resources (labor) because those unemployed people are not making any contribution to economic output in their country. 

\> Therefore, that country's GDP will be lower.

> #### Types of Unemployment:
>
> - **Cyclical or Demand Deficient Unemployment:**
>
>   - Unemployment caused by falling demand as a result of a downturn in the economic cycle. 
>   - Firms often react to falling demand by laying off stuffs in order to **save cost**.
>
> - **Structural Unemployment:** 
>
>   - Unemployment caused by **changes in structure of economy** such as a decline in an industry. 
>
> - **Sectorial Unemployment**: 
>
>   - Occurs when people are laid off because the industry they work in is in decline. 
>
>   * `For example, in most developed countries, over time, **manufacturing sector declines and the service sector grows**. As a result, the demand for labors in secondary sector will be lower and unemployment will be created.`
>
> - **Technological Unemployment:**
>   - Occurs when jobs that were previously done by people are now done by machines. **(labours are being replaced by technologies)** 
>
>   * `For example, banks have cut their workforces because people can bank online and get their   cash from Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs).`
>
> - **Regional Unemployment:** 
>
>   - Unemployment in a particular country is not likely to be the same in all regions. 
>
> - **Seasonal Unemployment:** 
>
>   - Some types of workers are only required for certain times of the year.
>   - `For example: farmers, holiday resorts, hotels, restaurants etc.`
>
> - **Voluntary Unemployment:** 
>
>   - There are a minority of people in society who choose not to work.
>
> - **Frictional Unemployment:**
>
>   - Short-term unemployment. It occurs when people are unemployed as they **move from one job to another.**

> #### Impact of Unemployment:
>
> - **Output:** 
>
>   - The productive potential of a country is not being fully exploited. 
>   - As a result, output will be lower. This means that the National Income and Living Standard will be lower(on average).
>   - However, if there is **technological unemployment**, the productivity may not be lower and even increase the output.
> - **Use of Scarce Resources: **
>   - People who are unemployed do not make any contribution to production.
>   - This is a waste of resources and results in lower levels of national income (income per capita).
> - **Poverty: **
>   - In some developing countries, there are not enough employment opportunities for all the people so they have to **live in poverty (no income support)**. 
>   - They may try to support themselves at a minimum level by growing some food on a plot of land, for example.
>   - The **state benefits provided by the government are generally lower than wages**. Those long-term unemployed people may lose their homes, extend to family break-ups and a lower self-confidence.
> - **Government Spending on Benefits:** 
>
>   - Unemployed people receive some financial benefit from the state and if unemployment raises , government have to spend more. 
>   - **This extra expenditure will cause an Opportunity Cost.**
> - **Tax Revenue: **
>   - When unemployment raises, **tax revenues will fall because most taxes are linked to income and spending**. 
>   - This means that government will have less money to spend and may borrow more money which increase national debt or it may increase tax rates.
> - **Consumer Confidence:** 
>   - During periods of high unemployment, consumer confidence will likely to fall because they may also lose their jobs. As a result, people will save more rather than spend. This means there is less consumption (aggregate demand) in the country.
