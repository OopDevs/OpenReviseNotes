## Unit 5 - Solids, Liquids and Gases

> **Specific Heat Capacity (S.H.C)**
>
> A unique property of any substance which shows the amount of Heat Energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of the substance by 1 *C.
>
> Formula:

$$
Heat\space Energy = m\times C \times \delta T
\\
(m: Mass)
\\
(C: S.H.C)
\\
(\delta T: Difference\space in\space temperature)
$$

> - Unit: J / kg *C
>
> - S.H.C of water = 4200 J / kg *C, meaning that water needs 4.2KJ heat energy to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1*C.
>
> - Oil heats up Faster because it needs less energy to heat up compare with water. So it has a lower S.H.C.

------

> **Kinetic Theory of Gases**
>
> - Pressure: mass acted per unit area
>
> - Formula:

$$
Pressure = Force\div Area 
\\
Pressure\space(in\space liquid)= h \times p\space _{(density)} \times g \space _{(gravity)}
$$

$$
Kinetic\space Energy = \frac1 2 \times m \times v ^ 2
$$

> The **Kinetic Theory of Matter** states that all of the particles that make up matter are **constantly in motion**. *(Brownian Motion)*
>
> Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of all the particles in an object.

------

> **The Kelvin Temperature Scale**
>
> - Kelvin is obtained by adding 273 to the Celsius temperature.
>
> - **Kelvin = Celsius + 273**
>
> - Unit: K
>
> - Absolute Zero = 0 k = -273 *C  (Absolute Zero does not exist in reality. All particles will stop moving at this temperature!)

​         

------

> **Gas Laws**
>
> - The relationship between the Pressure and Kelvin Temperature of a fixed mass of gas at constant volume is **Direct Proportional**.

$$
{P_1 \over T_1 } = {P_2 \over T_2}
$$

> - The relationship between the Pressure and Volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature is **Inversely Proportional**.

$$
{P_1 \times V_1} = {P_2 \times V_2}
$$



------

> **How is pressure created?**
>
> 1. The molecules are in random motion 
>
> 2. They collide with the wall of container
>
> 3. The motion changed direction so there is change in momentum
>
> 4. Thus pressure is created as P = F / A

$$
Change\space in\space Pressure=Change\space in\space Momentum (mv-mu)
\\
{(Change\space in\space Pressure)\over Time}={(mv-mu)\over t}

= {[m(v-u)]\over t}

= m \times a

= Force
$$



------

> **What will happen to the pressure when the temperature is increased?**
>
> 1. Kinetic energy will increase
>
> 2. Molecules move faster
>
> 3. Number of collision increases. (more frequently)
>
> 4. Forces increases and Pressure increases

------

> **The Pressure Law**
>
> For a fixed mass of gas, pressure is directly proportional to temperature at constant volume. *(pressure will increase when temperature is increased)*

$$
{P_1 \over T_1 } = {P_2 \over T_2}
\\
(temperature\space must\space in\space kelvin)
$$

## Unit 6 - Magnetism

>  **Learning Objectives**
>
> 1. know that magnets repel and attract other magnets and attract magnetic substances
>
> 2. Describe the properties of magnetically hard and soft materials.
>
> 3. Practical: investigate the magnetic field pattern for a permanent bar magnet and between two bar magnets
>
> 4. Understand the term magnetic field line.
>
> 5. Know that magnetism is induced in some materials when they are placed in a magnetic field.
>
> 6. Describe how to use two permanent magnets to produce a uniform magnetic field pattern.
>
> 7. Know that an electric current in a conductor produces a magnetic field around it.

------

> **Magnetism and Magnetic Materials**
>
> - Magnets are able to attract objects made from **magnetic materials** such as iron, steel, nickel and cobalt.
>
> - Magnets cannot attract objects made from materials such as plastic, wood, paper or rubber. These are **non-magnetic materials**.

> **Magnets**
>
> The strongest parts of a magnet are called its Poles. Most magnets have two poles: North Pole and South Pole.
>
> **Like poles repel (N-N or S-S)**
>
> **Opposite poles attract (N-S or S-N)**
>
> **Permanent magnets** are made from magnetically hard material as steel. It keeps its magnetism once it has been magnetized.
>
> **Temporary magnets** are made from magnetically soft material as iron. It loses its magnetism easily.

**How to make a magnet**: by keeping it inside a coil of wires carrying direct current (an electric current flowing in one direction only)

**How to demagnetize a magnet**: by keeping the magnet inside a coil wires carrying alternating current (an electric current that reverses its direction +-+-+-)

> **Magnetic Field**
>
> - Around every magnet, there is a volume of space where we can detect magnetism. **This volume of space is called a Magnetic Field**.
>
> - We draw magnetic fields using **magnetic field lines**. 
>
> - The magnetic field lines do not really exist but they help us to visualize the main features of a magnetic field. The magnetic field lines:
>
> 1. show the **shape** of the magnetic field
>
> 2. show the **direction** of the magnetic force - the field lines "travel" from north to south.
>
> 3. show the **strength** of the magnetic field - the field lines are closest together where the magnetic field is strongest. 



## Thermal Energy

---

- **Thermal Energy**

​       \- Thermal or Heat energy is the energy that flows from a hot region to a cold region by one or more of the processes of:

- - - **Conduction**
    - **Convection**
    - **Radiation**

------

- **Thermal Conduction**

​       \- Thermal conduction is how thermal energy flows through a substance without the substance itself moving.

​       \- Solids and metals are the best conductors, gases are the worst.

​       \- A vacuum does not allow conduction.

​       \- A poor conductor is called an insulator.

- **Thermal Conduction by Molecules**

​       \- Molecules vibrate more when they are heated.

​       \- Intermolecular forces allow the molecules to pass their vibration from one to another.

​       \- The stronger the forces are, the faster the vibrations are passed.

## Astrophysics

### Motion in the Universe ~

---

### The Solar System

### Planet

```sequence
Mercury -> Venus:
Venus -> Earth:
Earth -> Mars:
Mars -> Jupiter:
Jupiter -> Saturn:
Saturn -> Uranus:
Uranus -> Neptune:

```

> A planet is a body that orbits the Sun, which is **massive** enough for its own gravity to make it round, and has cleared its neighborhood of smaller objects around its orbit.

### Moon

> A moon is a body that orbits the planets.

### Asteroid

> An asteroid is a celestial body orbiting the Sun that is **not massive enough** to be spherical as a result of its own gravity.

### Satellites

> A satellite is an object that orbits a planet.
>
> There are two types of satellites:
>
> * **Natural satellite (moon)**
> * **Artificial satellite (Sky Lab)** 
>
> **Geostationary Satellites:**
>
> - All the geostationary satellites around the earth has a **time period of 24 hours.**
> - Circle in the same direction as the Earth's spin

### Comets

> A comet is a body **made of dust and ice** that occupies a highly elongated orbit.

### The planetary orbit

> The orbits of the planets are slightly squashed circles (ellipses) with the Sun quite close to the center.

### Speed of Earth

> $$
> Orbital\ Speed = {2\pi r\over\ T}  \\ 
> or\\ 
> Orbital\ Speed = {Circumference \over\ Time}
> $$
>
> 
>
> - Speed remains same
>
> - Direction of the motion is changing
> - Accelerating (Force = mass x acceleratioln)

### Why do objects move in a circle

> - According to Newton;s law of gravity: between any two objects there is always a force of attraction. 
> - The force of attraction is called **Force of Gravity**
> - **This force depends on:**
>   - The mass of the two objects (greater mass == greater force)
>   - Distance between the masses.

### Gravitational Attraction

> The force of gravity is responsible for the orbits of planets, moons, asteroids and comets.
>
> - It is always attractive.
> - Would double if either the mass of Sun or the planet was doubled.
> - Decreases by a factor of 4 as the distance between the Sun and a planet double

### Galaxies

> Galaxies consist of billions of stars bound together by the force of gravity.
>
> There are thought to be at least 200 billion galaxies in our Universe each containing on average 2 billion starts.
>
> The Milky Way is the name of our galaxy.

### Stars

> The brightness of a star depends on:
>
> * The distance of the star is from Earth.
> * What the start is made from and the kind of nuclear reaction that are taking.
>
> Luminosity:
>
> * The total power output of a star. (the total amount of rediation a stat emits per second)
> * It depends on both the radius of the star and its sufarce temperature.
