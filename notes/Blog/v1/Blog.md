### Event: Official Release of Open Revise

Date: 15th March, 2020, Sunday

> This is the official release of Open Revise, an open source revision website for all IGCSE students with notes, past papers and other useful materials.
>
> (https://openrevise.github.io/index.html)
>
> Nam (an amazing programmer) and I have been working on it in the past two months and everything you see on the website are coded with HTML, CSS and JavaScript by ourselves. Thus, it is understandable to have small bugs and we are trying our best to improve it and make it more user-friendly. If you have any problems / issues while using the website, please do not hesitate to contact me or Nam anytime you want. Your feedback is extremely important for the further development of the website.
>
> At this moment, there are only a few subject notes available due to the fact that there are only two developers and all notes are made by ourselves. In order to keep the high quality standards, we will upload new notes at a weekly basis and slowly cover all subjects. If you are willing to share your knowledge (in any form) with other students around the world, please do so and we are most appreciated to see that.
>
> If you want more information about the website, please check out the About page, where you can find many useful tips and the main concept of Open Revise.

> Best regards,
