## Chapter 3 - Memory and Processors

\> Memory is used to store instructions.

\> Processor executes those instructions.

### Memory

\>Memory can he accessed faster than secondary storage.

\>There are three types of memory:

- Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Read Only Memory (ROM)
- Flash Memory

\> **Random Access Memory (RAM)**

- Software is loaded into RAM from a computer's secondary storage. (e.g HDD)
- RAM is volatile, meaning it cannot store data when it has no power.

\>**Impact of the size of RAM on the user:**

- **Everything we see on the computer screen are stored in RAM.**
- The more RAM that is available, the more programs can run at the same time.
- When there is no enough RAM, the operating system will create virtual memory by using an area of secondary storage.
- Secondary storage is much slower than RAM.
- When a SSD is used as secondary storage, data is swapped to and from the SSD quickly and frequently.
- When programs or files are closed, they are removed from RAM.
- A user can add more RAM to a system.

\> **Read Only Memory (ROM):**

- ROM is non-volatile, meaning it stores data permanently.

- ROM is used in computer systems that store **only one program** (single purpose computers), such as calculators, digital watches and washing machines.

- General purpose computers also use ROM to **boot the system and load the operating system** from secondary storage.

- - ROM is generally used to refer to memory that cannot be changed after manufacture. Its full name is **Mask Programmed Read Only Memory.**
  - PROM stands for Programmable Read Only Memory. It is used in cell phones, video game consoles, medical devices and other electronics.

- Some types of ROM can be updated and change the contents:

- - EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)
  - EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)

\> **Flash Memory:**

- Flash memory is a type of EEPROM.
- **It is non-volatile.**
- It does not have any moving parts, so it has a fast access time and low energy consumptions.
- **It is used in the SSDs that are used in portable devices, such as laptop.**
- **It is often used as removable storage in USB drives and SD cards.**

### Processor

\> A processor is made up of one or more Central Processing Units (CPUs).

\> Each CPU is refereed as a core.

\> Processor Cycle: the process of fetching a program instruction from memory, decoding the actions required by the instruction and then executing those actions.

\> These carry out software instructions.

\> Processor speed is measured in **clock cycle per second** (the number of times per second the processor can carry out one or more instructions)

\> Clock cycle are measured in units called hertz (Hz), kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz).

# **Unit 2 - Connectivity**

------

## Chapter 4 - Digital Communication

\> Our world is connected by wired and wireless digital communication systems.

### Speed & Volume of Data Transfer

\> **Bandwidth:**

- def: The number of bits that can be carried by a connection in one second.
- The speed at which devices can transfer data depends on the bandwidth of the connection.
- A higher bandwidth makes uploads and downloads faster.
- A higher bandwidth also allows miltiplayer online gaming or high-definition video streaming.
- When streaming video, a portion of the video data is stored temporarily in an area of memory called a **Buffer**
- If the buffer is empty, there is no more video to play and it will pause until more data is downloaded into it.
- Data must be constantly downloaded into buffer to ensure a smooth video watching experience.

\> Latency:

- def: The delay in time it takes to send data between devices.
- If the latency is high, events will lag and will not seem responsive to user's commands.

\> Factors that affect speed & volume of data transfer:

- Transfer method:

- - Wireless methods have to work on a limited number of frequencies.
  - Copper cable (wired connection) can carry more frequencies which has more bandwidth available.

- Interference:

- - Other electromagnetic signals disrupt or interfere with wired and wireless signals.
  - Cable connections can be shielded from interference by wrapping the wires in a thin layer of metal.

- Blockages:

- - Walls and furniture reduce the strength of wireless signals which reduce the available bandwidth.

- Distance:

- - The strength of a wired or wireless signal is reduced as the distance that it has to travel increases.

### Devices-To-Device Communication

\> Devices can connect directly to each other using wired or wireless method.

\> Examples: 

- Smartphone - Headphones (using mini-jack)
- Laptop - External hard drive (using USB)
- Games controller - Games console (using Bluetooth)

### Network Communication

\> When two or more computers are connected, a network is created.

\> **Types of network:**

- - In a small geographical area (less than 1.5km).
  - Found in homes, schools and office buildings.

- **Wide Area Network (WAN):**

- - Spread over a large geographical area.
  - WANs has a wider reach and thus it often have slower transfer speeds than LANs.
  - Internet is the largest example of a WAN.

- **Personal Area Network (PAN):**

- - Smallest network used to connect personal devices.

- **Tethering:**

- - Connecting a host device that uses a mobile broadband connection with other devices so that they can use the host's broadband connection.
  - When internet tethering is done via Wi-Fi, it is also known as a mobile hotspot.
  - One of the biggest **advantages to using** **USB** **tethering** is that the handhold device will be charged
