### CITY OF JOY – KUALA LUMPUR

Kuala Lumpur, or KL, is the capital city of Malaysia, located near the Strait of  Malacca. It is one of the most developed cities in the world and it is also rich in cultures. Most importantly, living in KL is extremely interesting!

First of all, KL is a cosmopolitan city, where we can have different ethnic neighborhoods. Therefore, there is a mixture of different cultures! Also, it has a great commercial district in the city center with variety of stores and shopping complexes, so people can spend their free time for shopping!  

Without any doubt, Kuala Lumpur is a great city to live. There are, however, some minor issues in people’s daily life, causing inconveniences. The traffic is always not pleasant and there are very few public buses. I would like to suggest the government to add more public bus routes so people do not need to drive everyday!

### Sample 2

Q. There is a plan to close the local library. You have been asked to write a report for your School Magazine on this matter. In your report, you must:

> Give two reasons why the library may be closing.
>
> Give two reasons why the library should remain open.
>
> State how more people could be encouraged to use the library.

You must write between 100-150 words only.

### Report on The Matter of Local Library

This report will discuss the reasons of the closure of the local library and suggest why it should remain open, from the perspective of students.

It is an unfortunate news that our local library may be closing. These days, people have E-Book, so it is not necessary to borrow books. Also, the facilities in the library are really old, so people are not willing to go there anymore. These can be the main reasons why it may be closing down.

Without any doubt, having a library nearby is beneficial for all local people, especially students. This is because of the ‘studying environment’ created by the library is great for people to concentrate and it also provides a place for group study.

In order to encourage more people to use the library, it must updates the facilities regularly and add more popular books to attract people from different age groups.

### We Read, We Improve!

“Books are the ladders of human progress!” – Gorky

Reading, is one of the most essential skills we need to have in order be more knowledgeable and open our mind. It is important because nothing can be more enjoyable and effective than learning from a book.

For me, reading is absolutely the most fascinating way of leaning. I enjoy reading because I can find everything I need from the ‘sea of knowledge’ (books) and I can travel to anywhere I want in the ‘world of book’.

In my opinion, read what we like is the key of reading. I am a big fun of J. K. Rowling, so I love reading ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Cormoran Strike’ series! I also like books regarding to wild animals such as ‘The Jungle Book’ so I can know more about different species.

Sounds interesting? Start reading from today and you will love it!  148//

Dear Olaf,

It has been a long time since we met last time and I hope you are doing well. There are some great movies released in January and I would like to watch one with you!

As you know, I love science fictions. So I think we can watch the one called ‘AD ASTRA’ which describes an amazing adventure in the outer space! Are you interested? If not, what would you like to watch?

Let’s meet in KLCC, the city center at 10am tomorrow. It has the largest movie theater in KL and I believe it will be fun!

Best regards,

MengZe

### Sample 6

Dear Olaf,

I am glad to know that you are learning English. So in this email, I would like to give you some advice.

Learning English is a long journey and it will definitely worth your efforts because it is the most internationally used language. I believe the best way to master a language is to use it in your daily life. Therefore, you should communicate more with people who speak English. Also, making English labels of all the items in your house can be really helpful too!

Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any question.

Best regards,

MengZe                                           (Total: 100 words)

### Sample 7

**An Exchange Visit To Kuala Lumpur**

Participating in a school exchange program is a perfect opportunity for students to visit foreign countries, learn more about other cultures and most importantly, open their mind!

It was September 2019, ten students and two teachers were selected to visit Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia. The flight from London to KL took 13 hours and it was really an exciting journey! We were living in Uncle Lee’s host family and he was very nice to us. He guided us to KLCC, the tallest building in Malaysia, and also the National Museum with amazing paintings on the wall!

In my opinion, an exchange visit like this is extremely important for students to discover the world, because it provides an opportunity to communicate with local people and feel the cultures by ourselves!

## THE MODERN ECONOMIC SYSTEM vs. HUMAN CIVILIZATION

> This is an essay I wrote for a national competition and it has a quite high rating. It may not related to the exam but it is always good to learn a bit extra in case the exam is too tricky.

---

 Back to the early 3200BC, when our ancestors started this majestic and such mythical journey - **The Human Civilization**, as known as the ‘origin of human’. No one had ever expected what we have today, due to the limitation of imagination and the scarcity of resources. The history of humanity, all populations on earth, is the best way to explain the development of modern economic systems and the human activities.

 The American psychologist, Abraham Maslow, stated that there are three, and **only 3 basic human needs**: Food (including water), Shelter and Clothing. Without these needs being met, human will die and that’s what we can see in poor countries with absolute poverty. There are, however, something called **human want** which is not essential for survival, but for a better living standard. Due to the huge gap between these two concepts, people are living in completely different ways.

 China, as one of the largest economic unit in the world, has an average **real GDP growth of 6.6%**. In comparison, America has only 2.1%. As a result of this huge percentage increase and as a fact, the **AVERAGE** living standard of citizens has improved a lot. However, due to the unequal distribution of economic growth and some geographical restrictions, rich people became richer and poor people are living in almost the same conditions. Should we blame on the government? Definitely no because only the external factors, such as education and infrastructures can be determined by the government. Rich people are rich because they are doing right things and making the right decisions which can make them rich. It is a fact that poor people have less opportunities, but as President John F. Kennedy said, **Life is Unfair**!

 So, what’s next? The problem of this unequal society started in thousands of years ago! We human, as the most intelligent species on earth, is slowly dealing with this crucial fact. Poor people are trying so hard to change their lives by education, migration and finding opportunities; Rich people such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, are trying their best to accelerate the improvement of society and benefit other people; Government, is introducing minimal wages and better supply-side policies to create more job opportunities, and also improving the living standard directly by using expansionary monetary & fiscal policies (reducing tax). **Everyone is ‘fighting’ for a better life, not only for themselves, but for their future generations and for the future of humanity!** 

 Now we have the serious question: What can we do?

 As the **Generation Z**, we have thousands and millions of opportunities/possibilities to contribute and become ‘useful’. At this stage, ‘study **hard** and study **smart** can be the best preparation for our futures and making improvements EVERY SINGLE DAY can be the best way to achieve our goals! **Let’s fight for our future and for the future of humanity!**
